# Interpreter L_AC

Supporting dup, drop, swap, ., count, type, = and calculate.

Strings are stored in a circular array.

At the end of each interpretation, the stack content will be displayed.

Errors are treated differently, sometimes a false value would be returned into the stack, sometimes not.

It is highly unstable on encountering erroneous inputs.
